Эти меры Трамп использовал как экономическую дубинку, чтобы решать политические проблемы. Однако 20 февраля Верховный суд США признал их неконституционными. Сразу скажем, что суд не запретил введение тарифов, он лишь заявил, что IEEPA не может использоваться для получения дохода.По мнению судей, Трамп превысил свои полномочия, так как право устанавливать налоги и сборы принадлежит исключительно Конгрессу. По разным оценкам, правительство США может столкнуться с необходимостью вернуть торговым партнёрам и собственным импортёрам от 130 до 175 млрд долл. (половина от собранной суммы).

Исследование геофизиков из Колумбийского университета, опубликованное в Nature Communications, подтверждает, что в текущем столетии море здесь будет не наступать, а отступать. Этот процесс обусловлен фундаментальными законами физики и уникальным положением региона в системе глобальных изменений.Причиной феномена стал комплекс факторов — от изменения гравитационного поля Земли до тектонического \"отскока\" литосферы. Ученые предупреждают, что такое таяние ледников, лишающее остров колоссальной ледяной нагрузки, фактически заставляет сушу \"всплывать\". Это парадоксальное явление ставит под угрозу привычный уклад жизни местного населения и работу портовой инфраструктуры, создавая вызовы, с которыми человечество еще не сталкивалось в таких масштабах.В этом материале:Эффект пружины: почему Гренландия растет вверхГравитационный маневр океанских массПоследствия для экономики и навигацииОтветы на популярные вопросы о повышении уровня океанаЧитайте такжеЭффект пружины: почему Гренландия растет вверхЗемная кора обладает свойством, которое ученые называют постледниковым изостатическим отскоком. Если представить мантию планеты как вязкую жидкость, а кору — как гибкую платформу, то ледяной щит толщиной в полтора километра работает как гигантский пресс. В условиях, когда климат Европы и Арктики меняется, лед исчезает со скоростью около 200 миллиардов тонн в год, давление на недра ослабевает, и суша начинает медленно восстанавливать свою форму.",

Новое исследование ученых из Университета Флориды, опубликованное в Scientific Reports, проливает свет на фундаментальную \"первопричину\" превращения южного континента в ледяной панцирь. Оказалось, что ключевым триггером стала гигантская гравитационная аномалия — так называемая \"гравитационная яма\".Под этим термином исследователи понимают зону, где сила тяжести чуть слабее средних планетарных значений из-за пониженной плотности вещества под земной корой. С помощью сейсмического сканирования, напоминающего компьютерную томографию Земли, геофизики восстановили историю формирования этой аномалии за последние 70 миллионов лет. Выяснилось, что именно период между 50 и 30 миллионами лет назад стал переломным для облика нашей планеты.В этом материале:Природа гравитационной аномалии под ледникамиКак процессы в мантии изменили уровень океанаСвязь глубокой заморозки с движением вещества ЗемлиВлияние гравитации на современные ледяные щитыОтветы на популярные вопросы о гравитационной ямеЧитайте такжеПрирода гравитационной аномалии под ледникамиГравитационное поле Земли неоднородно: наша планета — это не идеальный шар, а геоид с массой \"вмятин\" и выпуклостей. В Антарктиде зафиксирована одна из мощнейших зон отрицательной аномалии. Когда плотность пород под корой снижается, притяжение ослабевает, что напрямую отражается на поверхности океана. Вода буквально \"стекает\" из зон со слабой гравитацией туда, где притяжение выше, формируя гигантские понижения водного зеркала.",
