          "description": "Язык РусскийТрамп передумал: вместо 10% пошлины теперь 15% на весь импорт в США Верховный суд США отменил часть тарифов Дональда Трампа как незаконные, и президент сразу объявил, что заменит их 10 % пошлиной на весь импорт. Но уже на следующий день Трамп передумал и заявил о «немедленном» повышении новой глобальной ставки до 15%, пишет Русская служба Би-би-си.Суд отменил часть тарифов, Трамп сначала объявил 10%, потом поднял до 15%21 февраля Дональд Трамп заявил, что повышает новые мировые пошлины до 15% «немедленно». Президент США связал этот шаг с решением Верховного суда о незаконности части его тарифов и назвал вердикт «чрезвычайно антиамериканским».В пятницу Трамп говорил, что заменит отменённые судом пошлины 10-процентным налогом на все товары, которые ввозят в США. Но уже в субботу он поднял ставку до 15%. «В течение следующих нескольких месяцев администрация Трампа определит и введёт новые, юридически допустимые пошлины, которые продолжат наш чрезвычайно успешный процесс возрождения величия Америки», — написал Трамп в Truth Social.В пятницу Верховный суд США признал незаконной часть масштабных импортных пошлин, которые Трамп вводил ранее. Суд проголосовал 6 голосами против 3 и решил, что президент превысил полномочия, когда ввёл пошлины на основе закона для чрезвычайных ситуаций национального масштаба. Судьи подчеркнули: для пошлин на импорт президенту нужно одобрение Конгресса.Трамп назвал это решение «глубоко разочаровывающим» и в пятницу объявил о переходе на 10% налог на весь импорт. На следующий день он поднял планку до 15%.Бывший торговый переговорщик США Дэниел Маллани, который работал и при Трампе, и при Обаме, сказал Би-би-си, что его удивил старт с 10%. По словам Маллани, многие ожидали, что Трамп сразу выберет Раздел 122 и поставит максимальную ставку 15%. Он добавил: 10% стали неожиданностью, а 15% уже выглядят логичнее.Маллани также отметил: пока непонятно, какие страны попадут под новые пошлины и как именно они будут работать вместе с уже действующими тарифами — «накладываться» сверху или включать их в себя.Что такое Раздел 122 и можно ли обойти ограничение в 150 днейПосле решения Верховного суда Трамп заявил, что введёт новые пошлины почти на весь импорт в США по закону, который раньше никто не применял: это Раздел 122 Закона о торговле 1974 года. Он позволяет президенту вводить тарифы до 15% на срок до 150 дней на импорт из всех стран без одобрения Конгресса. После этого Конгресс должен вмешаться.При этом Институт Като, аналитический центр правого толка, указывает на потенциальную лазейку: Раздел 122 прямо не запрещает президенту после истечения 150 дней объявить новое чрезвычайное положение и снова ввести такие же меры.Реакция Европы и позиция ВеликобританииВ Европе на заявление Трампа отреагировали жёстко. Канцлер Германии Фридрих Мерц назвал «ядом» постоянную неопределённость вокруг тарифов и заявил, что она вредит экономикам Европы и США. Он сказал журналистам, что будет тесно работать с другими странами ЕС, чтобы сформировать общую позицию перед поездкой в США, и добавил: в Вашингтон он поедет с «скоординированной европейской позицией».Президент Франции Эмманюэль Макрон заявил, что Франция внимательно изучит последствия новых глобальных действий и «адаптируется». Он подчеркнул: «справедливые правила предполагают взаимность, а не односторонние решения». Макрон также сказал, что нужно стремиться к подходу, который снизит напряжённость на международной арене, и продолжать модернизацию экономики.Правительство Великобритании заявило, что ожидает сохранения «привилегированного торгового положения страны в отношениях с США». В пятницу представитель Белого дома сказал, что страны, которые раньше заключили торговые соглашения с США, включая Великобританию, всё равно подпадут под глобальный тариф по Разделу 122, а не под ставку, о которой они договорились ранее.При этом британские договорённости по стали, алюминию, фармацевтической продукции, автомобилям и аэрокосмической отрасли, которые дают основную часть торговли с США, это решение не затронуло. Даунинг-стрит подчёркивает: теперь Вашингтон должен решить, сохранят ли эти соглашения силу. Представитель британского правительства добавил, что Лондон в любом случае ждёт сохранения «привилегированного торгового положения» и будет работать с администрацией США, чтобы понять, как решение повлияет на тарифы для Великобритании и остального мира.Сергей СташевскийЧитайте также:Верховный суд США отменил глобальные тарифы Трампа: что будет с пошлинамиТрамп заменил отменённые тарифы временной пошлиной 10% для всего мира Рубрика: Политика Язык Русский Мир Язык Русский Контекстные ключевые слова (Tags): Трамп поднял пошлины до 15%глобальная пошлина СШАновый мировой тариф Трампапошлины Трампатарифы Трампаглобальный тарифСШАДональд Трампрешение Верховного суда США тарифыВерховный суд признал тарифы незаконнымии Конгресс США одобрение тарифовреакция Европы на тарифы СШАФридрих Мерц неопределённость тарифовЭмманюэль МакронВеликобританияБелый домглобальный тариф для стран с соглашениямитарифы США для ВеликобританииПодрубрика: Семиднeвная ПанорамаПродвигать материал: 0Просмотры: 0Период: воскресенье, февраля 22, 2026",

Исследование геофизиков из Колумбийского университета, опубликованное в Nature Communications, подтверждает, что в текущем столетии море здесь будет не наступать, а отступать. Этот процесс обусловлен фундаментальными законами физики и уникальным положением региона в системе глобальных изменений.Причиной феномена стал комплекс факторов — от изменения гравитационного поля Земли до тектонического \"отскока\" литосферы. Ученые предупреждают, что такое таяние ледников, лишающее остров колоссальной ледяной нагрузки, фактически заставляет сушу \"всплывать\". Это парадоксальное явление ставит под угрозу привычный уклад жизни местного населения и работу портовой инфраструктуры, создавая вызовы, с которыми человечество еще не сталкивалось в таких масштабах.В этом материале:Эффект пружины: почему Гренландия растет вверхГравитационный маневр океанских массПоследствия для экономики и навигацииОтветы на популярные вопросы о повышении уровня океанаЧитайте такжеЭффект пружины: почему Гренландия растет вверхЗемная кора обладает свойством, которое ученые называют постледниковым изостатическим отскоком.

В условиях, когда климат Европы и Арктики меняется, лед исчезает со скоростью около 200 миллиардов тонн в год, давление на недра ослабевает, и суша начинает медленно восстанавливать свою форму.",

Новое исследование ученых из Университета Флориды, опубликованное в Scientific Reports, проливает свет на фундаментальную \"первопричину\" превращения южного континента в ледяной панцирь. Оказалось, что ключевым триггером стала гигантская гравитационная аномалия — так называемая \"гравитационная яма\".Под этим термином исследователи понимают зону, где сила тяжести чуть слабее средних планетарных значений из-за пониженной плотности вещества под земной корой. С помощью сейсмического сканирования, напоминающего компьютерную томографию Земли, геофизики восстановили историю формирования этой аномалии за последние 70 миллионов лет. Выяснилось, что именно период между 50 и 30 миллионами лет назад стал переломным для облика нашей планеты.В этом материале:Природа гравитационной аномалии под ледникамиКак процессы в мантии изменили уровень океанаСвязь глубокой заморозки с движением вещества ЗемлиВлияние гравитации на современные ледяные щитыОтветы на популярные вопросы о гравитационной ямеЧитайте такжеПрирода гравитационной аномалии под ледникамиГравитационное поле Земли неоднородно: наша планета — это не идеальный шар, а геоид с массой \"вмятин\" и выпуклостей.

Вот взять того же Дурова и TON, раз уж про них заговорили. Огромный мессенджер, огромная база потенциальных пользователей блокчейна. Ну как можно было все это просрать? Поддерживать бесполезные тапалки, ходить хвалиться - ой как у нас выросло количество кошельков в сети TON. Конечно, блять, выросло, когда только я лично знаю несколько команд, которые имели тысячи аккаунтов в хомяке/катизен/мажоре и прочих скаминах.При этом TVL блокчейна (количество заблокированных на смарт-контрактах средств) на сегодняшний день $85 млн., а общий объем торгов токенов $TON - $138 млн. Противно смотреть во что превратился некогда очень перспективный и популярный блокчейн. Преданная фанатская база прощала вам все косяки. Ждала - ну вот-вот все получится, ну не все сразу, ну нужно время на развитие. А вы в ответ - ловите еще пачку телеграм подарков, бедолаги. И возвращайтесь на заводы. Читать далее",

          "description": "Уравнение – традиционная иллюстрация к истории появления комплексных чисел в алгебре. Не удивительно: именно на примере этого уравнения итальянский инженер-математик 16 века Бомбелли показывал, как можно «разобраться с радикалами нового типа», которые он обнаружил. В статье решим это знаменитое уравнение несколькими способами, выведем формулу Кардано, – без которой рассказ об истории комплексных чисел тоже никогда не обходится, – попутно разберёмся, откуда именно в формуле возникает загадочное «отрицательное число под знаком квадратного корня». Кроме того, увидим, что на пути решения кубических уравнений дважды используются разные методы имени Виета, и выясним, действительно ли (каламбур) тут нужны комплексные числа или нет, и использовал ли их Бомбелли.В статье много многоэтажных формул. Способы решения уравнений рассматриваются с вычислительной, но не с «численной», точки зрения, поэтому упоминаются и программирование, и алгоритмы, но обошлось без кода на Rust. Читать далее",

Этот золотой треугольник будет обладать положительно обратной связью каждого элемента с каждым.Капитал усиляет исследования и технологии, исследования и технологии усиляют показатели капитала, исследования усиляют ии, ии выбирает куда лучше вложить капитал - выбирает оптимальный путь управления капиталом, капитал усиливает ии, и ии ускоряет технологии, являясь катализатором исследований.

Те компании, что торгуют мемами или обеспечивают мемную инфраструктуру имеют наибольшие показатели, остальные торгующие лесом, сталью, нефтью, газом и т. д. идут всеми силами в омемивании производства.Какая же следующая стадия, следующий логический шаг?
